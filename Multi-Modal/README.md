# Multi-Modal: PyTorch Research Replications and Educational Frameworks

This repository is a curated collection of **PyTorch-based implementations and educational replications** of key research papers in **multimodal AI, visual-language modeling, and modern sequence architectures**.  
It is designed as an **academic reference hub** for understanding and experimenting with deep learning models that integrate **vision, language, and attention-based architectures**.

---

## Overview

Each notebook in this repository replicates, simplifies, or extends a notable multimodal or visual-language paper.  
The goal is to **demystify complex architectures** through clear, annotated PyTorch code suitable for both research and teaching.
