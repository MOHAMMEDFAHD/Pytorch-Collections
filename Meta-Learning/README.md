##  Overview
**Meta-Learning** — often called *learning to learn* — is a rapidly growing field in AI focused on enabling models to generalize from limited data. Instead of relying on massive labeled datasets, meta-learning systems are trained through episodic tasks, building the ability to adapt quickly to new environments, modalities, and problem domains.

This repository, **`met-learning`**, is designed as a **living collection of labs, experiments, and educational projects** covering the wide spectrum of meta-learning approaches. From **Few-Shot Learning (FSL)** with Prototypical Networks and Matching Networks, to **meta-optimization**, **gradient-based adaptation (MAML)**, and **Transformer-based meta-learners**, this repo will grow into a comprehensive playground for research and applied exploration.

---

##  Goals
-  Provide **modular labs** exploring different meta-learning algorithms.  
-  Benchmark models across **synthetic tasks, computer vision, NLP, and audio**.  
-  Demonstrate **real-world applications** in healthcare, low-resource AI, and adaptive systems.  
-  Serve as an **educational resource** for students, engineers, and researchers.  
- Support **future contributions** with reusable pipelines, datasets, and evaluation tools.
