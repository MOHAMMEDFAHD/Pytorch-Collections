        "\n",
        "This paper introduces a scalable neural language model that overcomes the computational inefficiency of traditional neural probabilistic language models (NPLMs). It presents the **Hierarchical Log-Bilinear Model (HLBL)**, which organizes the vocabulary into a binary tree to drastically reduce computational cost while maintaining or surpassing the accuracy of flat models. The authors further propose a **feature-based algorithm** for automatic tree construction, allowing the model to learn efficient hierarchies from data without expert input. The result is a system achieving **state-of-the-art perplexity** with vastly faster training and inference.\n",

This makes them computationally impractical for large-scale datasets. | Introduce a **hierarchical structure** that replaces the flat softmax with a **binary tree of words**, reducing time complexity to \\( O(\\log V) \\) through sequential binary logistic decisions. |\n",
        "| **Manual or expert-dependent word hierarchies (e.g., WordNet)** | Earlier hierarchical NPLMs (Morin & Bengio, 2005) relied on expert-curated trees, which generalized poorly and underperformed compared to non-hierarchical models. | Develop a **feature-based automatic tree construction** algorithm using **data-driven clustering** of learned word embeddings, removing the need for expert knowledge. |\n",
        "| **Rigid single-code word representation** | Assigning each word a unique leaf (single code) prevents modeling of polysemy or multiple semantic senses of the same word. | Allow **multiple codes per word** within the hierarchical tree, improving representation of rare and polysemous words. |\n",
        "| **Inefficient and unstable base architectures** | Nonlinear neural models (e.g., multilayer NPLMs) recompute hidden layers repeatedly and exhibit training instability. | Use a **Log-Bilinear Model (LBL)** at each node — a linear, efficient, and stable model for predicting context-conditioned word vectors. |\n",

        "where \\( L(w) \\) is the path length and \\( q_i \\) is the vector for decision node \\( i \\).  \n",

        "The **average negative log-likelihood** declined rapidly within the first few epochs and plateaued near zero.  \n",
        "This pattern confirms both **rapid convergence** and **numerical stability**. It reflects the efficient gradient flow characteristic of **log-bilinear models**, where the loss landscape is smoother than that of nonlinear neural architectures.\n",

        "\n",
        "A **perplexity value of 1.001** implies almost perfect predictive certainty.  \n",
