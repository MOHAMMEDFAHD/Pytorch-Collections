        "**Observations:**\n",
        "- Training loss decreases sharply from ≈ **0.69 → < 0.01** by epoch 6.  \n",
        "- Test accuracy rises from **0 → 1.0** by epoch 5 and stabilizes.  \n",
        "- Convergence driven by:  \n",
        "  - Small dataset (8 sentences)  \n",

        "\n",
        "The replication confirms Alyafeai et al.’s core insight:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Optimization efficiency:** BiGRU + Adam + BCE achieve rapid, stable convergence (Tests 1–2).  \n",
        "- **Generalization weakness:** Word-level tokenization fails to capture Arabic morphological diversity (Test 3).  \n",
        "- **Framework consistency:** Experimental design and results align with the original study’s methodology (Test 4).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Therefore:**  \n",
        "The replication reproduces both the **strengths** (fast convergence, high accuracy) and **limitations** (semantic fragility, poor generalization) identified by Alyafeai et al. (2021), reinforcing the conclusion that **Arabic tokenization granularity and morphology coverage are central to LLM robustness**.\n"

        "The cited literature collectively establishes **two major motivations** for Alyafeai et al. (2021):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Cross-Linguistic Limitation:**  \n",
        "   Tokenizers optimized for English (e.g., BPE, SentencePiece) often fail to capture the **root–pattern morphology** and **clitic structure** of Arabic, leading to information loss and inflated vocabularies.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Linguistic Motivation:**  \n",
        "   Studies on **morphology-aware** and **character-based** models show improved handling of morphologically rich languages, but lack a **standardized evaluation framework** for Arabic.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Alyafeai et al. (2021)** bridge these perspectives by providing the **first large-scale, reproducible, quantitative evaluation** of both **linguistically informed** and **language-agnostic** tokenizers for Arabic NLP — uniting linguistic analysis and empirical benchmarking within a single framework.\n"
