        "In neural network training, the **Jacobian matrix** plays a central mathematical role in describing how information and gradients propagate through a network. Formally, the Jacobian is the matrix of first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function, making it the natural differential object for neural network layers that map input vectors to output vectors.\n",

        "While *Learning Representations by Back-Propagating Errors* (1986) introduced backpropagation algorithmically, a **Jacobian-based formulation** provides the precise mathematical language needed to explain *why* backpropagation works and *how* gradients behave in deep networks. From a modern theoretical perspective, backpropagation is most naturally understood as repeated application of the **vector-valued chain rule for Jacobians** across successive layers.\n",
