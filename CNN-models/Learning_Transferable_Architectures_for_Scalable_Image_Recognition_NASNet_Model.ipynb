        "This work introduces a scalable and transferable approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by designing convolutional **cells** on a small dataset (CIFAR-10) and transferring them to large-scale tasks (ImageNet, COCO). The authors propose the **NASNet search space**, which constrains the architecture to repeating *Normal* and *Reduction* cells, enabling transferability and efficient scaling. A reinforcement-learning controller explores this space and discovers cells that outperform all human-designed CNNs at publication time. The paper also introduces **ScheduledDropPath**, a new regularization method that enhances generalization. NASNet models achieve state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and COCO while using significantly fewer FLOPs than competing architectures.\n",

        "| **1** | CNN architectures are hand-designed and require extensive expert engineering. | Progress depends on slow, labor-intensive trial-and-error design; improvements are not systematic or scalable across tasks. | Introduces **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** with a **cell-based NASNet search space**, enabling an RNN controller to automatically discover high-performing convolutional cells. |\n",
        "| **2** | Direct architecture search on large datasets (ImageNet) is computationally infeasible. | Prior NAS efforts need tens of thousands of GPU-hours, restricting usage to large industry labs and preventing practical large-scale adoption. | Performs NAS on a **small proxy dataset (CIFAR-10)** and transfers the discovered cells to ImageNet, reducing NAS cost by an order of magnitude. |\n",
        "| **3** | Architectures learned on small datasets often fail to transfer to larger datasets or other tasks. | Every dataset/task becomes a separate design problem; discovered architectures generalize poorly, limiting reuse and scalability. | Designs the search space around **dataset-agnostic Normal and Reduction Cells**, enabling reliable transfer from CIFAR-10 → ImageNet → COCO detection. |\n",
        "| **4** | Existing architectures are not optimized for multi-scale computational constraints (mobile → large-scale). | Prior models come in only a few fixed sizes; adapting them for different FLOP/latency budgets is ad hoc and inefficient. | Defines a **scalable macro-architecture**: the same discovered cells can be stacked at different depths and widths to produce the full **NASNet model family**. |\n",
        "| **5** | NAS methods tend to overfit the search dataset, leading to architectures that fail under full training. | Architectures that appear strong during short proxy training runs often collapse when trained fully or transferred to real datasets. | Introduces **ScheduledDropPath**, a progressive stochastic drop mechanism improving robustness and generalization during full training. |\n",
        "| **6** | Limited evidence existed to justify reinforcement learning over simple baselines like random search. | Without empirical proof, RL-based NAS appeared unnecessarily complex and computationally wasteful. | Performs a controlled study showing **RL controllers outperform random search**, yielding higher validation accuracy and better top-k performance. |\n",
        "| **7** | Prior SOTA models typically excel in either classification or detection, but not both. | Deploying models across tasks requires separate architectures, complicating training, maintenance, and system integration. | Shows that **NASNet cells transfer across tasks**, achieving state-of-the-art ImageNet accuracy and superior COCO mAP when used as Faster R-CNN backbones. |\n",
