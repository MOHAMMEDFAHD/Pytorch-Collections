Rather, they are the culmination of a long intellectual trajectory that spans statistical physics, stochastic calculus, information theory, numerical analysis, and modern generative modeling. This section presents a coherent historical and theoretical synthesis of the key ideas that ultimately converged into contemporary diffusion and score-based models.\n",

        "\n",
        "The foundational idea of progressively injecting noise originates in the physical theory of Brownian motion.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the microscopic level, Brownian motion describes the seemingly random movement of particles suspended in a fluid.  \n",
        "Albert Einstein provided the first rigorous statistical explanation of this phenomenon, demonstrating how macroscopic diffusion emerges from microscopic randomness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Subsequently, the Fokker–Planck equation formalized how probability densities evolve over time under random motion. This equation describes the temporal dynamics of distributions rather than individual particle trajectories.\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This formulation introduced what is now recognized as a **forward diffusion process**, in which structured states are gradually corrupted by noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Later, Kiyosi Itô developed the mathematical framework of **stochastic differential equations (SDEs)**, enabling rigorous treatment of random processes whose paths are almost surely non-differentiable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, Brian Anderson formalized **reverse-time stochastic processes**, proving that under specific conditions diffusion processes admit a mathematically well-defined time reversal.\n",
